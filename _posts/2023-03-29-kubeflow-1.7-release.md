The AI/ML landscape is evolving rapidly thanks to the emergence of the latest transformer models. With Kubeflow, ML model developers can leverage pythonic workflows and Kubernetes-native operations to iterate faster and take advantage of all their available resources. The new Kubeflow 1.7 release builds upon this foundation by providing better user interfaces and new workflows that enable in depth model insights and faster model delivery.

With Kubeflow pipelines, users can capitalize on their python knowledge to build seamless workflows without the need of Kubernetes CLI commands and without building container images for each step. With new UIs in multiple components, developers can correlate configuration parameters with logs and allow them to analyze their results in a faster manner.

As model developers migrate from older model architectures to transformers, they also need to efficiently leverage resources.  Kubeflow’s efficient Kubernetes-native operations, especially for workload placement and autoscaling, reduces resource utilization and operational toil.   One of the many enhancements in Kubeflow 1.7 is the ability to use Kubeflow Pipelines’ new Parallelfor statements.  Parallelfor enables model developers to quickly add parallel processing and leverage TPUs/GPUs more efficiently. This is especially apparent when compared to RNN based model’s sequential processing and their challenges with exploding and diminishing gradient values.

1.7 includes hundreds of new commits, and the following provides details of the top features.  You will also find updates on platform dependencies, changelogs, breaking changes, ecosystem partners (Ray, MLflow and BentoML), the new Kubeflow community security team and Kubeflow's transition to the CNCF. We encourage active users to contribute to our next release, and provide links to ways to join the community as well.

## Selected and Highlighted deliveries


### Katib 

Katib includes new enhancements to the UI and SDK. The new Katib UI provides simplified fine-grained configuration and log correlation. Additionally sorting and filtering have been added, allowing a more organized view of your many experiments. In addition, these features minimize the necessity of manually employing low-level commands to locate and correlate logs with hyperparameter experiment configurations. This simplifies the process of in-depth performance analysis and subsequent iterations of model parameters.

In 1.7, the Katib SDK provides new features including a Tune API  and the ability to get trial metrics from the Katib database. Model developers or data scientists can execute the Tune Python API to start a HyperParameter Experiment without any knowledge of underlying systems(Kubernetes, Docker). It automatically converts user training scripts to a Katib Experiment. The Katib changelog provides details on over 100 updates and bug fixes including these SDK and UI top features:

<br />

* Narrow down Katib RBAC rules ([#2091](https://github.com/kubeflow/katib/pull/2091))
* Support Postgres as a Katib DB ([#1921](https://github.com/kubeflow/katib/pull/1921))
* [SDK] Create Tune API in the Katib SDK ([#1951](https://github.com/kubeflow/katib/pull/1951))
* [SDK] Get Trial Metrics from Katib DB ([#2050](https://github.com/kubeflow/katib/pull/2050))
* More Suggestion container fields in Katib Config ([#2000](https://github.com/kubeflow/katib/pull/2000))
* Katib UI: Enable pagination/sorting/filtering ([#2017](https://github.com/kubeflow/katib/pull/2017) and [#2040](https://github.com/kubeflow/katib/pull/2040))
* Katib UI: Add authorization mechanisms ([#1983](https://github.com/kubeflow/katib/pull/1983))

<br />

### Training operator

Kubeflow’s unified distributed training operator enhancements include configuration options for fine tuned resource scaling (processor, memory, storage). It now includes HPA support for Pytorch Elastic workloads where users can specify target metric/utilization in Job Spec. This is used for automatic scale up/down of Pytorch Job matching demand while ensuring the elastic policy configured by the user.  This simplifies user workflows significantly and reduces operational toil and costs. It supports multiple scheduler types: Kubernetes, volcano, custom.   Major 1.7 training operator features include:

<br />

* PodGroup enhancements([#1574](https://github.com/kubeflow/training-operator/issues/1574))
*  Integration with other training frameworks - Paddlepaddle([#520](https://github.com/kubeflow/community/issues/520))
*  Enhancements on Pytorch Elastic training ([#1645](https://github.com/kubeflow/training-operator/issues/1645), [#1626](https://github.com/kubeflow/training-operator/issues/1626))
*  Support coscheduling plugin ([#1722](https://github.com/kubeflow/training-operator/issues/1722))
*  [SDK] Create Unify Training Client([#1719](https://github.com/kubeflow/training-operator/pull/1719))

<br />

### Pipelines

Model developers recognize the time-saving pythonic workflows in Kubeflow Pipelines, which speed iteration by not requiring the generation of new images for pre-prod experimentation.   The new V2 UI and SDK in Kubeflow 1.7 provide valuable details on each pipeline step.   This simplifies the correlation and analysis of parameters, metadata and artifacts during iteration.

In 1.7, KFP also includes enhancements for [control flow functionality](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/components/pipelines/v2/author-a-pipeline/pipelines/#dsl-control-flow-features).  There are multiple scenarios when a model developer needs to use control flow and pipeline topology enhancements to define a sub-graph in a pipeline ([#8326](https://github.com/kubeflow/pipelines/pull/8326)):

<br />

* ParallelFor ( [#8146](https://github.com/kubeflow/pipelines/pull/8146)) : 
    * Parallelfor allows users to slice large data into smaller batches, which delivers parallel task execution when iterating over elements in a list.
* Condition([#8179](https://github.com/kubeflow/pipelines/pull/8179), [#8204](https://github.com/kubeflow/pipelines/pull/8204), [#8209](https://github.com/kubeflow/pipelines/pull/8209)): 
    * Only executed when a certain condition is met (like if-else condition).
* ExitHandler( [#8220](https://github.com/kubeflow/pipelines/pull/8220)): 
    * Acts as the last code logic before finishing a pipeline.
    * The Exit Handler is executed given the pipeline run is successful or failed.
* Pipeline in a pipeline: 
    * A future capability to run a pipeline inside a pipeline, which enables encapsulation and pipeline template sharing/reusing.

<br />

To visualize the control flow and pipeline topology enhancements, the PR above has enabled an interface for model developers to inspect the Sub-DAG execution spec (execution time, start time, input/output, etc.), and it also allows model developers to dive deep into the sub-DAG components. For example: Model developers can view all the iterations of a ParallelFor task, so they can determine and debug the iterations with failure. All components in Sub-DAG have their corresponding ML Metadata representation, so the model developer can also inspect their properties.


### Kubeflow web apps (Notebooks, Volumes, TensorBoards) and Controllers

Kubeflow 1.7 delivers new enhancements to the web apps that aim at exposing more information to the end users and improve their interactions with the web apps.

A valuable new delivery is that all of the main tables have filtering [#6754](https://github.com/kubeflow/kubeflow/pull/6754) and sorting [#6742](https://github.com/kubeflow/kubeflow/pull/6742) functionalities as well as showing objects from all namespaces at once [#6778](https://github.com/kubeflow/kubeflow/pull/6778). This allows the end users to navigate through their tools and apps (notebooks, tensorboards, volumes etc) more efficiently.

Additionally, 1.7 provides and update to the Notebooks form page [#6826](https://github.com/kubeflow/kubeflow/pull/6826) as well as a dedicated page [#6769](https://github.com/kubeflow/kubeflow/pull/6769) [#6788](https://github.com/kubeflow/kubeflow/pull/6788) for the different types of tools managed by Kubeflow. These detailed pages allow users to view logs, events and configuration yamls and they also link from one another (i.e. going to a volume’s details page via a notebook details page). Previously these functions were only available through the Kubernetes API,  which would require the user to have increased privileges and to have a more in-depth knowledge of Kubernetes CLI commands. With these new features the user has a simpler, more organized and more secure way of accessing crucial Kubeflow resource information.

Other notable features are small improvements on our user stories around PodDefaults. Aside from additional use-cases, like defining sidecar and init containers [#6749](https://github.com/kubeflow/kubeflow/pull/6749), Kubeflow’s TensorBoard stack now integrates with PodDefaults [#6874](https://github.com/kubeflow/kubeflow/pull/6874) [#6924](https://github.com/kubeflow/kubeflow/pull/6924). These enhancements enable users to easily re-use their existing PodDefaults to gain access to S3 from both Notebook and TensorBoard servers.


### Platform dependencies, breaking changes, add-ons 

Kubeflow 1.7 includes hundreds of commits. The Kubeflow release process includes several rounds of testing by the Kubeflow working groups and Kubeflow distributions.  Kubeflow’s configuration options provide a high degree of flexibility. Considering not all options can be tested, the 1.7 Release Team narrowed the critical dependencies for consistent testing and documentation to the following.

Another valuable platform enhancement is the support of additional processor architectures including IBM’s Power ([#6684](https://github.com/kubeflow/kubeflow/issues/6684)). This effort provides the foundation to add other processor types as well.

The 1.7 documentation includes overall [installation instructions](https://github.com/kubeflow/manifests#kubeflow-manifests) from the Manifest Working Group, and detailed feature reviews from each Kubeflow working group.  Most of the working groups have broken their changelogs into subsections that highlight core features, UI enhancements, miscellaneous updates, bug fixes and breaking changes.

Working Group Changelogs including breaking changes

* [Notebooks](https://github.com/kubeflow/kubeflow/releases) 
* [Training Operator](https://github.com/kubeflow/training-operator/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)
* [Katib](https://github.com/kubeflow/katib/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)  
* [Pipelines](https://github.com/kubeflow/pipelines/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)  
* [KServe](https://github.com/kserve/kserve/releases/)

The community has continued its work to identify core components and add-ons.  Significant enhancements in add-ons include the continued integration with KServe’s v.10 release, as well as a new serving option from BentoML. The BentoML team has done a tremendous job in supporting the Kubeflow community in 1.7 and their documentation is excellent.  Details on BentoML are available [here](https://modelserving.com/blog/streamline-production-ml-with-bentoml-and-kubeflow).  


## What’s next

The community continues to see a large increase in activity since the [announcement](https://blog.kubeflow.org/kubeflow-applied-cncf-incubating/) that Kubeflow will be donated to the CNCF by Google. The community holds regular meetings to review progress on the checklist items needed for the CNCF due diligence ([meeting notes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HXAl6ew5ZUgQaAnEHS1qEPxA5puUz2knUwXOZHU39sA/edit?userstoinvite=mchmarny@google.com&actionButton=1)).

During the 1.7 release cycle, the community formed a Security Team, which is working to improve the security profile of Kubeflow components and their dependencies. The Security Team has completed these three deliveries:

<br />

1. Set-up a github directory, slack channel and regular meeting schedule with [notes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10_uYpaFWvY2NyqGBPd0dbTt1RumX8MedNcGzKSdtSOY/edit?pli=1#)
2. Created an [inventory](https://github.com/kubeflow/manifests/blob/v1.7-branch/docs/kf_images.txt) of container images used by Kubeflow
3. Created a list of common vulnerabilities and errors (CVEs) in the container images.

<br />

Going forward, the Security Team will work to develop on-going policies and to remedy security issues.  For example, fixing CVEs is an on-going maintenance requirement and this function is currently provided by Kubeflow distribution providers as a value added delivery. Some distributions and end-users are working to fix CVEs in the upstream projects and the Security Team is looking for help on defining and delivering those deliveries and expectations.

The Kubeflow team is working on integration efforts with the Ray and MLflow communities.   The Ray integration progress has moved closer to user testing and users can find more information on this [tracking issue](https://github.com/kubeflow/manifests/pull/2383). The MLflow integration is progressing and its integration is tracked [here](https://github.com/kubeflow/kubeflow/issues/6647).
